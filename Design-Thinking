My goal during studies in university is to learn and familiarize myself about 
the new system and technologies with various kinds of programming languages and 
also gain as much knowledge and experience for further uses in my career as a software engineering.

I had gained some experience from this design thinking project,
which is the way to work efficiently as a team even though we couldn't meet up
physically due we are working and we only study during weekend, but we managed to
conduct virtual meetings and carry out our project. This shows that there is always a solution to the problem,
sometimes we just have to think outside the box.

I believe that good communication skills are important when it comes to teamwork.
Hence, to make myself more competitive in industry, I have to improve my soft skills 
besides strengthening my professional skills in data engineering.
